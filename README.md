## 🚀 Local Development & Deployment

### Prerequisites

- [DFINITY SDK (dfx)](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/setup/sdk-installation/) installed
- Node.js and npm (for frontend builds, if needed)
- A modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge)
- A public key from **Solana** wallet
- Internet access

### Steps

1. **Clone the repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Asdiqaat/vaultstamp-v2.git
    cd VaultStamp
    ```

2. **Start the ICP Local Replica**
    ```bash
    dfx start --background
    ```

3. **Generate and Build Canisters**
    ```bash
    dfx generate
    dfx build
    ```

4. **Deploy the Canisters**
    ```bash
    dfx deploy
    ```

5. **Build the Frontend (if you make changes to JS/CSS)**
    ```bash
    # If you use npm scripts for bundling/minification
    npm install
    npm run build
    ```

6. **Run the Frontend**
    - Open `src/vaultstamp_frontend/index.html` directly in your browser  
      *or*  
    - Use a live server extension (e.g. VS Code Live Server) for hot reload
